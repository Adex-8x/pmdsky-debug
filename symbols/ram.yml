        Pointer to the dungeon struct in dungeon mode.
        
        This is a "working copy" of DUNGEON_PTR_MASTER. The main dungeon engine uses this pointer (or rather pointers to this pointer) when actually running dungeon mode.

        Pointer to the dungeon struct in dungeon mode.
        
        This is a "master copy" of the dungeon pointer. The game uses this pointer when doing low-level memory work (allocation, freeing, zeroing). The normal DUNGEON_PTR is used for most other dungeon mode work.
