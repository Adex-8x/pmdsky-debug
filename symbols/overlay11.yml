    The script engine.
    This is the "main" overlay of ground mode. The script engine is what runs the ground mode scripts contained in the SCRIPT folder, which are written in a custom scripting language. These scripts encode things like cutscenes, screen transitions, ground mode events, and tons of other things related to ground mode.
